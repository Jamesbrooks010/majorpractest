economy should be able to 

1. allow customers to take out financial products and hold cash while repaying over a certain amount of time 
2. change interest rates dependent on the levels of debt to savings in the economy 
3. allow institutions to change their local interest rates dependent on whether or not there is a cash surplus of high amounts of debt 

4. allow for the issuing of insurance contracts 
5. create some amount of customers and run through different scenarios within the economy I.e Bankruptcy shocks, high amounts of cash 

6. hold the list of customers.
